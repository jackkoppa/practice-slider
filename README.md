## Front-End Dev Test for a Web Agency ###

### Requirements ###

"You can create this page any way you want, but there are some ground rules
we must absolutely insist on."

- You may not use a third party slider library. You need to create your
  slider component *from scratch*.
- We need to see *two* slideshows on the page.
- The slideshows must loop.
- The web page must work on these browsers:
    - Google Chrome 51+
    - IE 10+
    - Firefox 47+
    - Safari

### Highlights ###

* slider is completely functional as a looping show, when changed by clicking arrow navigation, and when pausing/playing
* an aesthetically pleasing loading bar for easy understanding of slider status
* minor parallax effect with title overlay
* heavy use of SASS, in order to manage variables & significant nested declarations
* jQuery for smooth animations, both on image sliding and loading bars
- Important Files:
    - index.html
    - js/slider.js (changeable variables to adjust experience)
    - styles/slider.scss
    - styles/variables.scss (changeable variables to play w/ aesthetic)
